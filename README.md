# DAN (Deep Affinity Network)

## 

This is my work to implement DAN for engineer project. I programmed and improved the tracking of the DAN with PyTorch and visualized and evaluated the tracking results in three inputs, which were created based on detecting the MOT17 dataset using DPM, FRCNN, and SDP detector respectively. Besides, I connected the tracking implemented based on DAN with the detection on the server
